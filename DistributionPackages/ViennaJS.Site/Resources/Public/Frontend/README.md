# ViennaJS Frontend

To start the project run:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

As long as `npm start` is running, it will **watch** your changes. You can edit `_sass/main.scss` and `_javascript/main.js` at will. Changes are **immediately** compiled to their destinations, where `index.html` will pick them up upon reload in your browser.

Some controlling output is written to the `npm start` console in that process:

```sh
_javascript/main.js -> lib/main.js

=> changed: $HOME/projects/start-with-bulma/_sass/main.scss
Rendering Complete, saving .css file...
Wrote CSS to $HOME/projects/start-with-bulma/css/main.css
```

Use `npm run` to show all available commands:

```sh
Lifecycle scripts included in bulma-start:
  start
    npm-run-all --parallel css-watch js-watch
